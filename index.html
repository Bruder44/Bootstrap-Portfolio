<h2>About Me</h2>
<img class= "ID" src= "Assets/Images/biopic.jpg">
<div class= "p1">Hi, my name is Matt Bruder, I am a 28 year-old aspiring Full Stack Web Developer. I have had the fortune of working and gaining experience in multiple different industries throughout my twenties. I've worked as a delivery driver, DJ, warehouse supervisor, health product salesman and even as a mechanic at Jiffy Lube.</div>
<div class= "p2">After all these valuable experiences, I have decided to commit myself to studying to become a Full Stack Web Developer. I look forward to the challenge and look forward to meeting any challenges put in front of me.  Some of my current hobbies include listening to music, watching and playing soccer, fishing, of course coding and the little things in life! </p></div>
