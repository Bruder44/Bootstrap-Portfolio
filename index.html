<h2>About Me</h2>

<div class= "p1">Welcome to my website, my name is Matthew Bruder and I am a Full Stack Web Developer.  Throughout my life I have always been passionate about the internet and after jumping from one industry to another throughout my short working career, where I've worked as a delivery driver, DJ, warehouse supervisor, health product salesman and even as a customer service representative and upper bay technician at Jiffy Lube.  I finally decided to pursue my passion in full-stack web devlopment.

<div class= "p2">Through pursuing this passion after gaining valuable experiences in other industries, I am extremely excited to continue commit myself to becoming the best Web Developer I can be. I look forward to all the possible opportunites this industry holds and look forward to meeting any challenges put in front of me.  Please take a minute to look around my Portfolio to see previous projects I have completed, feel free to contact me through here as well. Currently, when not coding my hobbies include finding new music, watching and playing soccer, fishing, of all the little things in life! </p>
